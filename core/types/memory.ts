/**
 * These memory methods may not follow what you're used to when it comes to memory management,
 * and are mainly to be used for niche use-cases and experiments.
 *
 * A heap address holds an arbitrary amount of bytes, and is used to index a Uint8Array.
 * Using ArrayBuffers and DataViews is a more robust method of handling memory.
 *
 * @example
 * # Heap
 * const address = kernel.memory.allocate(1024);
 * kernel.memory.write(address, new Uint8Array(1024).fill(1));
 * const value = kernel.memory.read(address)
 *
 * # Stack
 * kernel.memory.push(value)
 * console.log(kernel.memory.peek())
 * kernel.memory.pop()
 *
