[ecmaOS](https://ecmaos.sh) is a [browser-based operating system kernel](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/spiceworks/original/4X/8/7/b/87b7be8e7e2cd932affe5449dba69dc16e30d721.gif) and suite of applications written primarily in TypeScript, AssemblyScript, and C++. It's the successor of [web3os](https://github.com/web3os-org/kernel).

The goal is to create a kernel and supporting apps that tie together modern web technologies and utilities to form an "operating system" that can run on modern browsers, not just to create a "desktop experience". It offers the ability to run a wide variety of apps on top of a (mostly) sandboxed foundation, offering some measure of security by default. Its main use case is to provide a consistent environment for running web apps, but it has features that allow for more powerful custom scenarios. The kernel could also be repurposed as a platform for custom applications, games, and more.

## Basic Overview

- `Apps`
  - These are full applications that are developed specifically to work with ecmaOS
  - An app is an npm package, in which the bin file has a shebang line of `#!ecmaos:bin:app:myappname`
  - Its default export (or exported `main` function) will be called with the `ProcessEntryParams` object
  - They can be installed from the terminal using the `install` command, e.g. `# install @ecmaos-apps/boilerplate`
  - Run the installed app: `# /usr/bin/boilerplate arg1 arg2` *(absolute path not required)*
  - During development, it can be useful to run a [Verdaccio](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio) server to test local packages: `# install @myscope/mypackage --registry http://localhost:4873`
  - To publish to Verdaccio, run `# npm publish --registry http://localhost:4873` in your app's development environment
  - Then to install from your local registry, run `# install @myscope/mypackage --registry http://localhost:4873`

- `BIOS`
  - The BIOS is a C++ module compiled to WebAssembly with [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org) providing performance-critical functionality
  - The BIOS has its own filesystem, located at `/bios` ‚Äî this allows data to be copied in and out of the BIOS for custom code and utilities
  - The main idea is that data and custom code can be loaded into it from the OS for WASM-native performance, as well as providing various utilities
  - Confusingly, the Kernel loads the BIOS ‚Äî not the other way around

- `Core`
  - Core modules provide the system's essential functionality; this includes the kernel itself
  - Other core modules include BIOS, Jaffa, Metal, SWAPI, as well as the main `@ecmaos/types` package

- `Commands`
  - Commands are small utilities that aren't quite full Apps, provided by the shell
  - Some builtin commands that exist now will be moved into separate apps over time

- `Devices`
  - Devices get loaded on boot, e.g. /dev/bluetooth, /dev/random, /dev/battery, etc.
  - A device can support being "run" by a user, e.g. `# /dev/battery status`
  - Devices may also be directly read/written, and will behave accordingly (or have no effect)
  - An individual device module can provide multiple device drivers, e.g. `/dev/usb` provides `/dev/usb-mydevice-0001-0002`

- `Jaffa`
  - Jaffa is a [Tauri](https://tauri.app) wrapper for the ecmaOS kernel
  - It's used to tie the kernel into a desktop or mobile environment, allowing for native functionality

- `Kernel`
  - Authentication (WebAuthn)
  - Components (Web Components/Custom Elements)
  - Devices
  - DOM
  - Events (CustomEvents)
  - Filesystem (ZenFS)
  - Internationalization (i18next)
  - Interval Manager (setInterval)
  - Log Manager (tslog)
  - Memory Manager (Abstractions)
  - Process Manager
  - Protocol Handlers (web+ecmaos://...)
  - Service Worker Manager
  - Shell
  - Storage (IndexedDB, localStorage, sessionStorage, etc.)
  - Terminal (xterm.js)
  - User Manager
  - WASM Loader
  - Window Manager (WinBox)
  - Workers (Web Workers)

- `Metal`
  - Metal is an API server for allowing connections to physical systems from ecmaOS using [Hono](https://hono.dev)
  - Authenticated and encrypted connections with JWK/JWE/JOSE

- `Modules`
  - Modules are dynamically loaded into the kernel at boot and can be enabled or disabled
  - They can provide additional functionality, devices, commands, etc.
  - They offer a [common interface](./core/types/modules.ts) for interacting with the kernel
  - Generally they should be written in [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org), but this isn't required

- `Packages`
  - Packages are [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com) that are installed into the ecmaOS environment
  - They can be installed from the terminal using the `install` command, e.g. `# install jquery`
  - NPM version specifiers are supported, e.g.:
    - `# install jquery@3.7.1`
    - `# install jquery@^3.7.1`
    - `# install jquery@latest`
  - [JSR](https://jsr.io) support is coming soon

- `SWAPI`
  - The SWAPI is an API server running completely inside a service worker using [Hono](https://hono.dev)
  - e.g., `# fetch /swapi/fake/person/fullName`

- `Utils`
  - Utilities and configuration used during development

## Command Examples

```sh
ai "Despite all my rage" # use `env OPENAI_API_KEY --set sk-`
cat /var/log/kernel.log
cd /tmp
echo "Hello, world!" > hello.txt
chmod 700 hello.txt
chown user hello.txt
clear
cp /tmp/hello.txt /tmp/hi.txt
download hello.txt
edit hello.txt
env hello --set world ; env
fetch https://ipecho.net/plain > /tmp/myip.txt
fetch /xkcd-os.sixel # xterm.js includes sixel support
fetch /swapi/fake/person/fullName # fetch a random person from the SWAPI
install jquery
ls /dev
mkdir /tmp/zip ; cd /tmp/zip
upload
mount myuploadedzip.zip /mnt/zip -t zip
cd .. ; pwd
unzip zip/myuploaded.zip
mv zip/myuploaded.zip /tmp/backup.zip
passwd old new

## Device Examples

```sh
/dev/audio test
/dev/battery status
/dev/bluetooth scan
echo "This will error" > /dev/full
/dev/gamepad list
/dev/geo position
/dev/gpu test
/dev/hid list
/dev/midi list
echo "Goodbye" > /dev/null
/dev/presentation start https://wikipedia.org
cat /dev/random --bytes 10
/dev/sensors list
/dev/serial devices
/dev/usb list
/dev/webgpu test
cat /dev/zero --bytes 10 > /dev/null
```

Note: many device implementations are incomplete, but provide a solid starting point

## Early Days

The kernel is currently in active development. It is not considered stable and the structure and API are very likely to change in unexpected and possibly unannounced ways until version 1.0.0. Use cautiously and at your own risk.

Things to keep in mind:

- Things have changed a lot since the tests were written, so they need to be updated and fixed
- The kernel is designed to be run in an environment with a DOM (i.e. a browser)
- Many features are only available on Chromium-based browsers, and many more behind feature flags
- Command interfaces won't match what you might be used to from a traditional Linux environment; not all commands and options are supported. Over time, Linuxish commands will be fleshed out and made to behave in a more familiar way.
- Globbing doesn't work in the terminal yet

## Development

[Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) is used to manage the monorepo, and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) is used for package management.

A good place to start is viewing the `scripts` property of [package.json](./package.json) in the root of the repository.

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/ecmaos/ecmaos.git

# Install dependencies
cd ecmaos && pnpm install

# Run the dev server
pnpm run dev

# Run the docs server
pnpm run dev:docs

# Build
pnpm run build

# Run tests
pnpm run test
pnpm run test:watch
pnpm run test:coverage
pnpm run test:bench
pnpm run test:ui

# Generate modules
turbo gen device # generate a new device template
```
